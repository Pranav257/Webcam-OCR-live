 
# Live Feed OCR Project

This project consists of two main Python scripts that utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from live video feeds and static frame images. The project aims to provide a foundation for applications requiring real-time text recognition and processing in various scenarios such as surveillance, accessibility features, or augmented reality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on setting up the project locally to run and test the OCR capabilities on your own video feeds and images.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install pytesseract
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-feed-ocr.git
cd live-feed-ocr
```

### Usage

To run OCR on a live video feed, use the following command:

```bash
python live_feed_ocr.py
```

For OCR on static frames:

```bash
python OCR_ON_Frames.py
```

Both scripts will output the recognized text in the console.
